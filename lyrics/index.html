			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p> Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"</p>
			<p>These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is <span>bloody shoes</span></p>
			<p>Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose</p>
			<p>And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable,</p>
			<p>look, I don't dance now, I make money moves</p>
			<p>Say I don't gotta dance, <i>I make money move</i></p>
			<p>If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you</p>
			<p>I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make <span> bloody moves</span></p>

			<h3>Verse 1</h3>
			<div id="div2">
			Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
			<br>Cardi B, you know where I'm at, <i>you know where I be</i>
			<br>You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
			<br>I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
			<br><i>Honestly,</i> don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
			<br>Dropped two mixtapes in six months, <i>what bitch working as hard as me?</i>
			<br>I don't bother with these hoes, <i>don't let these hoes bother me</i>
			<br>They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
			<br>Look, I might just chill in some BAPE, I might just chill with your boo
			<br>I might just feel on your babe, my pussy feel like a lake
			<br>He wanna swim with his face, 
			<br>I'm like, <b>"Okay"</b>
			<br>I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
			<br>And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse, I got the trunk in the front
			<br>I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
			<br>Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know <i>it ain't cheap</i>
			<br>And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
			<br>Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

			<p> Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"</p>

			<h3>Verse 2</h3>
			<div id="div2">
			If you a pussy, you get popped, you a groupie, you a opp
			<br>Don't you come around my way, <i>you can't hang around my block</i>
			<br>And I just checked my accounts, turns out,<span class="second_span"> I'm rich,</span><span class="third_span"> I'm rich,</span><span class="fourth_span"> I'm rich</span>
			<br>I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
			<br>I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
			<br>My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil bitch play her role
			<br>I just a-rove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
			<br>I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
			<br>I need to let all these hoes know that <i>none</i> of their niggas is safe
			<br>I go to dinner and steak, <i>only the real can relate</i>
			<br>I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
			<br>Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
			<br>Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
			<br>I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
