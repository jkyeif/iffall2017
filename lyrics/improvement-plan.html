		<h1>Jane Kye Lyrics Improvement Plan</h1>
		<h2>Original Image</h2>

		<p> At first, I was completely lost at what to design. I wanted to use a gold background to convey Bodak Yellow and a sense of wealth. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Revision 1 with Ashley Tsai</h2>
		<br>
		<img src ="images/lyrics_mockup.jpg">
		<p>Then with Ashley, it was suggested that the new gold background did not really read as gold but rather a paint texture. Also that the type face choice was a bit hard to read. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Revision 2 with Nick Rogers</h2>
		<br>
		<img sr="images/lyrics_mockup2.jpg">
		<br>
		<p>With Nick, I had some of the type changed to a simple, sans serif. He suggested I brought the opacity of the gold background back up because he thought the text was actually not that hard to read. </p>
