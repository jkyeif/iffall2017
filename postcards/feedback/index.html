		<h1> Nick Rogers Postcard Feedback </h1>
		<br>
		<h2> Postcard Design 1 </h2>
		<p> Desktop version's image is pretty blurry, perhaps find a better quality image. Good typeface, readable quote, nice size. </p>
		<p> Mobile Version has very good quality image, good image-text relationship, quote remains readable and a good size. Good sense of placement. </p>

		<h2> Postcard Design 2 </h2>
		<p> Both images are very blurry, please find a better quality image. Quote is good size, readable, and ties together with quote treatment in first design. </p>

		<h2> Postcard Design 3 </h2>
		<p> Desktop version's image is of good quality and has a nice pop of orange. Quote treatment is nice, and ties in with other two postcards. </p>
		<p> Mobile version needs a better quality image. Quote treatment reamains good. </p>
